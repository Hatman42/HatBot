# Contributing Guidelines
###### What to do always do when contributing HatBot

We should not contribute bad commands that lead to inappropriate content, such as adult content or lead to harmful websites.

Very bad swearing is bad, such as n#####. Do not do this.

We should also not try to insert bad code, like the bot deletes every channel in the server.

**This is the rules for contributing our bots code. Please follow these guidelines. They are important to follow.**

# Info on Contributing

If you are contributing, please notify Hat so he can add your code to the bot. This is because it doesnt sync to my computer automatically. Thank you.
