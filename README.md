# HatBot Source Code

HatBot is a Discord Bot that is for the Discord server **HatCord**. It is kinda a useless bot, but can kick members that have a role lower than HatBot. But it can respond to commands.

## Commands
There are many commands like:
```
h!info
h!hi
h!abouthatbot
h!introduce
h!help
h!kick [DISCORD USERNAME]
```
and much more. This bot has features, but has a few features such as
- Responds to you're commands
- Fun commands
- Can kick people that have roles lower than the bot

Yes, this bot is not that good because it only responds to commands, and just kick people, and not really powerful things.

You can take the source code to make your own of it, and replace the client ID with your own.

You can also change the prefix in your own bot if you are taking the source code.

## NOTICE!

**_If you are taking the source code for this bot, do note that you have to replace the "your_own_token" with your DISCORD BOT CILENT ID, or else your bot may not work._** **_This is ALSO coded with Python, so other coding languages may not work._**
