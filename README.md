# HatBot Source Code

HatBot is a Discord Bot that is for the Discord server **HatCord**. It is kinda a useless bot which only does commands that responds to you.

## Commands
There are many commands like:
```
h!info
h!hi
h!abouthatbot
h!introduce
h!help
```
and much more. This bot has features, but very few features such as
- Responds to you're commands
- Fun commands

Yes, this bot is not that good because it only responds to commands, and not really powerful things.

Also, forgot to mention, you can take the source code to make your own of it, and replace the client ID with your own.

## NOTICE!

**_If you are taking the source code for this bot, do note that you have to replace the "your_own_code" with your DISCORD BOT CILENT ID, or else your bot may not work._** **_This is ALSO coded with Python, so other coding languages may not work._**

Bot created on September 12, 2017. GitHub project created on October 28, 2017.
